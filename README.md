## Introduction

**RSFDA** 

The Riemannian Spatial Filtering with Domain Adaptation (RSFDA) algorithm is a pioneering framework that integrates Riemannian spatial filtering (RSF), manifold embedded feature alignment (MEFA), and stacking ensemble learning with time-frequency feature fusion (TF-Stacking). This synergy enables significant enhancement of cross-session motor imagery (MI) EEG classification performance without requiring extensive retraining. The core innovations lie in:

* Riemannian Spatial Filtering (RSF): Leveraging geometric optimization in Riemannian space to extract low-dimensional discriminative features, RSF dramatically reduces computational complexity while preserving critical neural information.
* Manifold Embedded Feature Alignment (MEFA): By aligning feature distributions across sessions through manifold learning, MEFA minimizes domain shifts and enhances generalization across temporal variations, eliminating the need for frequent model recalibration.
* TF-Stacking Ensemble Learning: Combining time-frequency domain feature fusion with hierarchical ensemble learning, this module amplifies classification accuracy and robustness, capturing both temporal and spectral discriminative patterns.

The algorithm‚Äôs modular architecture ensures seamless integration of these components, facilitating future extensions and adaptability. Collectively, RSFDA achieves superior efficiency, generalization, and precision, positioning it as a transformative solution for real-world BCI applications.

**Key Features**: Brain-computer interface ([BCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface)), motor imagery ([MI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_imagery)), electroencephalography ([EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography)), [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry), [domain adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_adaptation) and cross-session.
